    <p>No, not at this time.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <strong>What Features Does The UACF API Have?</strong>
      <p>Please refer to the UACF documentation found <a href="/docs">here</a>. All information about accessible data is documented for your reference.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>I Receive A 302 (Redirect) – Why Is That?</strong>
    <p>You probably forgot to put a / on the end of the URL. For collections, use v7.0/&lt;endpoint&gt;/ and for items use v7.0/&lt;endpoint&gt;/&lt;id&gt;/.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Is There A Difference Between A “Client” And “Consumer”?</strong>
    <p>A Consumer Key and Client ID are the same thing. A Consumer Secret and Client Secret are the same thing. The terminology “Client” is being used for OAuth2.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <strong>How Should I Use The API For Routes / Activity / Groups For Events?</strong>
      <p>We often work with races and sporting events. Through our API you can have access to specific routes and activity. If you are interested in partnering for an event, please contact support at <a href="mailto:Partner-Support@underarmour.com">Partner-Support@underarmour.com</a>.</p>

    <p>This is a highly requested feature, and is coming soon. Thanks for your patience.</p>

    <strong>What Is The Max (Scale) Of Daily Requests?</strong>
    <p>Our standard API accounts have a max 25,000 requests/day and 60 requests/second.

  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>I’m Seeing OAUTH_1 Errors When Trying To Use OAuth2. Why?</strong>
    <p>Make sure you’re using https://oauth2-api.mapmyapi.com/ for OAuth2. Also make sure that you are using an “Api-Key” header with your OAuth2 client_id and an “Authorization” header with any access token you have. If you do not yet have an access token, make sure your access token request follows the example in the <a href="/docs/v71_OAuth_2_Demo">OAuth2 demo</a> on <a href="//developer.underarmour.com">developer.underarmour.com</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
      <strong>Question: Do I Need A Scope / How Do I Use Them?</strong>
      <p>No, we are currently not using scopes.</p>
  </section>

    <p>If you are interested in seeing UACF API examples, visit Github:</p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>I Have Received A “Developer Inactive” Response. What Does This Mean?</strong>
    <p>Make sure your OAuth2 request includes an “Api-Key” header with your client ID and that your request is using the host https://oauth2-api.mapmyapi.com.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Problem: I Get A “Callback_uri Didn’t Match” Error</strong>
    <p>Make sure your callback uri matches exactly, query strings that vary will result in this error. Information that you may want to put in query strings should be url encoded and anything you want passed back needs to be put in the “state” parameter.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Problem: Migration From OAuth1 To OAuth2, And Receive A 403 Error On API Request</strong>
    <p>Make sure you’re delivering the credentials in the “Authorization” header, not the body.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Request For Enterprise API Access</strong>
    <p>If you need Enterprise API, put your request here. We will need: company, application, target audience, scale of use (requests per second and expected number of requests per day).</p>

  <section>

    <p>Under Armour Connected Fitness brand assets and company information are <a href="http://about.mapmyfitness.com/brand/">available here</a>.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>Do You Offer SDKs In Platforms Other Than Mobile?</strong>
    <p>No, not at this time. Check back here for future enhancements or consider signing up for an Enterprise account for access to special features.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <strong>What Is The Difference In A Basic API Access Versus Enterprise API Access?</strong>
    <p>Consumers with an Enterprise account may have higher request limits. An Enterprise account is probably best if you anticipate a large user group. Features are basically the same between the two.</p>
