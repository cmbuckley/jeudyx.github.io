            <p class="text-center">Create engaging cross-platform health and fitness experiences for web,
                <br/>mobile, and wearable devices.</p>

            Our platform powers thousands of partners and developers, along with our full suite of Under Armour applications: MyFitnessPal, MapMyFitness, MapMyRun, MapMyRide, MapMyWalk, and MapMyHike.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission to help make all athletes better through passion, design and innovation keeps us true to delivering a platform that is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>turn-key and state-of-the-art</li>
            <li>optimized for insights over information</li>
            <li>driven by social experiences</li>
            <li>and inspires athletic performance</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p>
            For wearables, our lightweight SDK encapsulates key algorithms that help you deliver the same authentic performance as in mobile or web. At this time, we are working with select partners to bring our wearable SDK to devices. If you would like to be one of them, please
            <a href="mailto:Partner-Support@underarmour.com">contact us</a>.
        </p>-->
        <p>
            On Web, we follow a RESTful approach to designing our APIs. Requests and responses use JSON in a familiar REST style. Clients use standard HTTP methods â€“ POST, GET, PUT, DELETE, to update resources. You can get a quick overview of our APIs before you get started.
