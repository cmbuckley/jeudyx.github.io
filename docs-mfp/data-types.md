# Data Types

## Timestamps

All timestamps are represented in either of two fully detailed ISO 8601 format:

    ● Local time, including time zone: ​YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD
    ● UTC time: ​YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
    
The following examples represent the same moment in time as experienced in four different
time zones, as well as UTC:

    ● 2014-03-24T14:45:42-07:00 
    ● 2014-03-24T22:45:42+01:00 
    ● 2014-03-24T23:45:42+02:00
    ● 2014-03-25T06:45:42+09:00 
    ● 2014-03-24T21:45:42Z
