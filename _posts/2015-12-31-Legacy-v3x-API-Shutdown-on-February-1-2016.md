Notice to all legacy API users of version before v7.0 that official support will be dropped on February 1, 2016 (one year after the release of v7.0).

In addition **_all v3.x APIs_ will be decommissioned and completely removed on February 1, 2016**. All clients should have migrated to v7.x.

The rest of our APIs will continue under the support schedule outlined in our [Versioning Policy.](/versioning_policy)
